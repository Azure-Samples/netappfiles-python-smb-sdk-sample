# Azure NetAppFiles SMB SDK Sample for Python

This project demonstrates how to deploy a volume enabled with SMB protocol using python language and Azure NetApp Files SDK for python.

In this sample application we perform the following operations:

- Creation
  - NetApp Files Account
  - Capacity Pool
  - SMB enabled Volume
- Clean up created resources (not enabled by default)

If you don't already have a Microsoft Azure subscription, you can get a FREE trial account [here](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=330212).

## Prerequisites

1. Python (code was built and tested under 3.9.5 version)
2. Azure Subscription
3. Subscription needs to be whitelisted for Azure NetApp Files. For more information, please refer to [this](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-register#waitlist) document.
4. Resource Group created
5. Virtual Network with a delegated subnet to Microsoft.Netapp/volumes resource. For more information, please refer to [Guidelines for Azure NetApp Files network planning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-netapp-files/azure-netapp-files-network-topologies)
6. For this sample Python console application work, we need to authenticate and the chosen method for this sample is using service principals.
    1. Within an [Azure Cloud Shell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-shell/quickstart) session, make sure you're logged on at the subscription where you want to be associated with the service principal by default:
        
        ```bash
        az account show
        ```
   
        If this is not the correct subscription, use:
   
        ```bash
        az account set -s <subscription name or id>  
        ```

    2. Create a service principal using Azure CLI
        
        ```bash
        az ad sp create-for-rbac --sdk-auth
        ```

        >Note: this command will automatically assign RBAC contributor role to the service principal at subscription level, you can narrow down the scope to the specific resource group where your tests will create the resources.

    3. Copy the output content and paste it in a file called azureauth.json and secure it with file system permissions
    4. Set an environment variable pointing to the file path you just created, here is an example with Powershell and bash:

        Powershell
   
        ```powershell
        [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("AZURE_AUTH_LOCATION", "C:\sdksample\azureauth.json", "User")
        ```
        
        Bash

        ```bash
        export AZURE_AUTH_LOCATION=/sdksamples/azureauth.json
        ```

        >Note: for other Azure Active Directory authentication methods for Python, please refer to these [samples](https://github.com/AzureAD/microsoft-authentication-library-for-python/tree/dev/sample).
    
7. Active Directory infrastructure setup with one or more DNS servers from the AD domain (usually the Domain Controllers) available in the **same virtual network** where you're setting up Azure NetApp Files. If you want to setup an Active Directory test environment, please refer to [Create a new Windows VM and create a new AD Forest, Domain and DC](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/application-workloads/active-directory/active-directory-new-domain) for a quick setup, then you can create the subnet delegated to Microsoft.Netapp/volumes in the vnet that is created.

# What is example.py doing? 

This sample is dedicated to demonstrate how to deploy a Volume in Azure NetApp Files that uses SMB protocol, similar to other ANF SDK examples, the authentication method is based on a service principal, this project then will ask for the Active Directory user password and after validating that it is not null, it will create a single volume with a single capacity pool using standard service level tier and finally the SMB Volume. It also implements a function to test if the subnet exists before start creating any resources, called `resource_exists`.

There is a section in the code dedicated to remove created resources, by default this script will not remove all created resources, this behavior is controlled by a variable called `SHOULD_CLEANUP`, if you want cleanup right after the creation operations, just set it to `True`. For a more advanced python example, please see the first item in the references section of this document.

SMB Volumes will require that you have an Active Directory domain available for you to use, with the DNS Servers you will define (as comma separated string) within the same virtual network (any subnet with exception of ANF Volume's delegated subnet) where your ANF service will use to setup its volumes. The username provided must be a user that has rights to domain join computers and although we setup Active Directory at NetApp Account level, the SMB server will be created only when the volume gets deployed. Finally, you will notice that the SMB server created in AD will be appended with the SMB Server prefix you configured plus a sequence of random characters, up to 15 in total name length. This application will output the final SMB server FQDN as highlighted in the [screenshot](#SampleOutput).
